# CS353 Database Systems Project

Our system, ŞuBilet, is an online ticket purchasing application for various travel types in Turkey. Through our system, travelers are able to reserve and purchase transportation tickets, write reviews for their trips, create journeys and purchase/reserve the trips in their journeys, and use coupons to make discounted transactions. Our other user type, travel companies, are able to create travels for travelers to purchase, and also manage their travels as they desire. Admins of our system are able to manage the system, validate companies, delete users, and also generate various reports about the statistics of the website.

ŞuBilet relies on a MySQL database and exclusively manually written SQL queries to retrieve and manage its information. Backend of the project is written in Python with Flask and the frontend functionalities are realised through Python’s Jinja template.
